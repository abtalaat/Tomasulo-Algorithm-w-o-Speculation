# Tomasulo-Algorithm-w-o-Speculation
The Tomasulo algorithm, implemented without speculation, is a project that simulates a dynamic scheduling technique used in computer architectures, particularly in superscalar processors. This algorithm optimizes the execution of instructions by allowing them to execute out of order. and bypassing data dependancies.
